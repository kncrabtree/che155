# Notes added 2023-09-25:
# With the current loadout, installing scipy >= 1.8 causes conda to hang.
# Psi4 1.8 requires a version of libint that cannot be found, so we're using 1.7.
# Cannot install qcelemental=0.26, which is the first version that does not break when using Pydantic 2.
# Therefore we force Pydantic version to 1.
# Pandas 2.1.1 requires tables >= 3.7 and numexpr >= 2.8.
# Jax requires cudatoolkit-dev in week 10. (Removed because I don't teach it.. and the pkg. seems too large)
# Added TensorFlow.
# Added conda-forge/label/libint_dev because MacOS needs it to install psi4>=1.7 (it tries to install 1.8).
# 
# Notes added 2022-09-17:
# Installing all packages in one go, without specifying psi4 version, could cause psi4 1.4 or 1.5 to be installed.
# They may cause undefined symbol or segfaults at the import/run stage, so installing those versions is unacceptable.
# (2023-09-25: This isn't a problem anymore)
# Freeing the Python version number will cause 3.10 to be installed which will lead to conflicts on Mac when installing the second batch.
# Installing psi4 will sometimes cause a very old version of numpy to be installed. Version pinning ensures it is not too old.
# scipy 1.7.3 will complain if numpy is newer than 1.22.
# pingouin older than 0.5 will have a different API that breaks scipy calling ttest notebook in week 2.
# ipywidgets < 8 is added because nglview will throw AttributeError: 'super' object has no attribute '_ipython_display_' otherwise.
# (2023-09-25: This isn't a problem anymore)
