    "In this experiment, H$_3^+$ ions react with excess HD at 13.5 K to produce H$_2$D$^+$, D$_2$H$^+$, and D$_3^+$ through a series of elementary deuteration reactions. The data from the figure above were digitized, and this folder contains a csv file containing the ion count as a function of time for each species. First, we can import and inspect the data using `pandas.read_csv()`. Since the csv files do not contain column headers, we supply our own headers with the `names` keyword argument. Then, since the units of time in the csv file are ms, we divide the time column by 1000 to convert to seconds. This will be convenient down the road."

    "The code raises an exception! It happens that our model fails when any of the two rate coefficients are equal because it leads to division by zero. This is one pitfall of numerical computing: you have to be very careful about potential divide by zero errors. It is also a flaw with the approach we're using! Integrated rate equations are susceptible to these situations in general. Next week we will see a completely different strategy for avoiding this problem, but for now we're going to stick with the integrated rate equations, so we need to handle this. One possiblity is to rederive the rate laws for each possible pair of equal rate coefficients and select which one we use based on a series of equality tests. That would be very tedious, and in this case it turns out to be unnecessary.\n",

The Hugo et al. paper did not explicitly state the uncertainties on their rate coefficients, but we could assume they are comparable to the last significant digit.

The $1\\sigma$ uncertainties on the parameter estimates are larger, and in the case of \\[H$_3^+$\\]$_0$, the error is larger than the parameter value! Clearly this model cannot do a good job of extracing the initial density of H$_3^+$. The main issue is that the covariance matrix has very large off-diagonal elements that indicate strong correlations between parameters. This means that the model performs almost identically well if two parameters are varied together. For instance, the `pcov[0][1]` element shows the covariance between \\[H$_3^+$\\]$_0$ and $k_1$ as -1.6e7, which is midway between the variances of those two parameters (given by `pcov[0][0]` and `pcov[1][1]`, respectively).

    "## Simultaneous fitting with `scipy.optimize.least_squares`\n",
    "\n",
    "We've seen that the `curve_fit` approach we have been using is somewhat limited because it only handles one curve at a time. What we'd really like to do is optimize all 4 parameters (\\[H$_3^+$\\]$_0$, $k_1$, $k_2$, and $k_3$) while minimizing the squared differences between _all_ of our experimental data points. This is beyond the capabilities of the `curve_fit` function, which is designed only to fit one set of y data.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can accomplish this simultaneous fitting task with the help of the [`scipy.optimize.least_squares`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.optimize.least_squares.html) function. Take a moment to look at the documentation. The operation of `least_squares` may be a bit nonintuitive, especially if you are used to `curve_fit`. Instead of supplying a fit function, x data points, and y data points, when using `least_squares`, you provide a function that produces an array containing the _residuals_ of the model function(s) given an array of parameter values `x`. Conceptually, `least_squares` calculates a total cost function `F` (by default, this is equal to `0.5*np.sum(residuals**2)`) and attempts to minimize it by varying the parameters. To vary the parameters, it evaluates the derivative of the cost function with respect to each parameter. By default, this is done by finite differences: calculating `F` with slightly different parameter values `x` and computing $\\Delta F/\\Delta x_i$, but if you can compute the derivative analytically, you can provide this yourself via the Jacobian matrix (argument: `jac`). We could do this for our system: we would need to evaluate the derivatives of each rate equation with respect to each parameter. However, the finite difference method is usually sufficient, and the only real advantage to proviging the Jacobian matrix is to speed up the calculation by decreasing the number of times `F` has to be calculated. For us, calculating `F` is fast, so it's not a problem to do it; however, if computing `F` takes a long time, then it is beneficial to provide the Jacobian.  It reaches the endpoint when one of the following conditions is met (each can be controlled by an optional argument):\n",
    "\n",
    "- `max_nfev`: When the number of function evaluations exceeds a certain value (default, 100 times the number of parameters)\n",
    "- `ftol`: When the change in the cost function satisfies `dF < ftol*F`. By default, `ftol=1e-8`\n",
    "- `xtol`: When the change in the parameters becomes small. \"Small\" means different things depending on the exact algorithm used, so see the documentation for details\n",
    "- `gtol`: When the norm of the gradient of the cost function is small. Again, see documentation for exact details, as this varies by algorithm\n",
    "- If an error occurs in the calculation\n",
    "\n",
    "The function provides three different solvers: `lm`, `trf` (default), and `dogbox`, which each have their own advantages and disadvantages, and in some cases additional optional arguments. Sticking with the default `trf` or `dogbox` allows you to optionally provide `bounds` on each of the parameters: upper and lower limits that the optimization must respect.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also very important to understand is the meaning of the `loss` argument: this controls how the cost function `F` is computed from the residuals. The detault, `linear`, provides a normal least squares solution. However, more generally, a loss function `rho` can be applied to each squared residual before it is summed: `F = 0.5 * np.sum( rho(residuals**2) )`. This can be used, for example, to make a fit more robust in the presence of outlier data or do other more advanced types of fitting. Using the option `soft_l1`, for example, takes a squared residual `z` and calculates `2 * ((1 + z)**0.5 - 1)`. This function behaves least squares for small residuals, but is proportional to the absolute value of the residuals when they are larger, making the cost function less sensitive to large outliers. Most often, though, sticking with the default is a good idea.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the `least_squares` can take optional `*args` and `**kwargs` parameters that are passed through to the loss function. Use those to pass the experimental data to fit. Here, we'll construct our loss function."

This is usually what we want: it means that all parameters have likely reached their optimal values. If, instead, `xtol` was the termination condition, it likely means that we would need to rescale one or more of the parameters to minimize the cost function. We can also see that the optimization was fast: only 5 function evaluations were required. In part this is because we had good initial guesses for the parameters. The results are sensitive to this initial choice: bad guesses can cause the optimization to find a local minimum that is not the best fit, or can cause the fit to fail. For this reason, it is very important to have a good strategy for coming up with initial guesses!

    "The final result, though not perfect, is the best fit we can make given the integrated rate equations that we are using. It is best to use this global fitting approach because it makes maximum use of how the fit parameters are related to all of the experimental data, not just a part of it. For example, the best probe of the \\[H$_3^+$\\]$_0$ parameter is actually \\[D$_3^+$\\], because at long times, our model predicts that essentially all of the starting H$_3^+$ is converted to D$_3^+$. This in turn yields a different value (932) than we obtained from the fit of H$_3^+$ itself (919), which in turn affects $k_1$, and so on. All of the parameters are coupled, so fitting all of the data simultanously gives the best estimate of the parameter values.\n",

    "Clearly, though, despite these efforts the model does not completely account for the trends seen in the data. One possibility is that \\[HD\\] is not actually constant, but starts to run out near the end of the experiment. That would cause the conversion of D$_2$H$^+$ $\\to$ D$_3^+$ to slow down. In order to work this in, we would need to rederive the rate equations, and it is possible that there is no closed-form solution to the integrals that come out of that process. Another potential issue is that ion traps are not perfect: some ions are lost over time either because they escape the trap or because they are neutralized by another reaction. Adding that process in would require refderiving integrated rate equations yet again, and that becomes very difficult! If we had a more complicated system of reactions, it would be completely impossible to use our current approach. We will look at another method next week."
