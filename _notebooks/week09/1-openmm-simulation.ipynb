    "### Introduction: Running OpenMM simulations\n",
    "OpenMM is a bit different from other MD simulation programs because there is no executable OpenMM program; instead it has an easy to use Python API for setting up and running simulations.  One could think of the OpenMM input file as being a short Python script or Jupyter notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Resources\n",
    "The [OpenMM Script Builder](http://builder.openmm.org/) is a web app that assists in creating Python scripts for OpenMM simulations.  Once you are done with this notebook and ready to use features like protein force fields, periodic boundary conditions and temperature / pressure controls, you may use the Builder to generate a script with the correct OpenMM API calls.\n",
    "\n",
    "The [OpenMM documentation page](http://openmm.org/documentation.html) is very high-quality. Before reading the docs you're encouraged to watch the two short videos on the landing page given by Peter Eastman, the OpenMM developer.  There are also various OpenMM-related videos that you can find on YouTube from past workshops given at Stanford, including some from Lee-Ping."
