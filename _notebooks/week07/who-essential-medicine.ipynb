    "A powerful feature of RDKit is the ability to perform structure alignment.  This is a calculation in which the structures of two conformations are compared by applying a translation and rotation to one confomation, called the probe, in order to minimize the distances to a reference conformation.  After applying the rotation and translation, the remaining Euclidean distances between the atoms of the probe and reference structure are a measure of the \"internal\" structural differences due to differences in bond lengths, etc.  By taking the RMS of all the displacements for each atom, one can calculate the \"RMSD\" which is a single number that measures the difference between two structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to rotate two structures to minimize the distances between corresponding atoms, both structures need to have the same atom ordering, which is actually not true for our experimental structure and the generated one.  What's more, the atoms of the probe and reference structure need to be the same, and this is not strictly true for our example either, because our experimental structure is actually a hydrochloride salt, containing an extra HCl that the generated structure doesn't have.  RDKit takes care of both of these problems by finding a substructure that the probe and reference structures have in common; the substructure matching also generates a mapping of the atom orderings between one structure and the other, so we are able to get a result without worryinng."
