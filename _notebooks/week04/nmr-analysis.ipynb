That function needs to be in a particular form: its first argument must be the independent variable, and the remaining arguments are the parameters that will be optimized. Our `lor` function already satisfies this requirement. `xdata` and `ydata` are the data to fit, and `p0` is a list of initial guesses for the parameters. The size of `p0` must be the same as the number of parameters in the model function (i.e., one less than the total number of arguments). The parameters `sigma` and `absolute_sigma` can be used if the data points have error bars already associated with them. The `bounds` parameter can be used to place restrictions on the values of the parameters during the optimization by providing a list of tuples setting the min and max allowed value for each parameter. For instance, we know that the peak area must be a positive number, so we could set a bound of `(0,np.inf)`. If `bounds` is not set, then the parameters are allowed to take on any value, and sometimes the fit can go crazy (especially when the initial guesses are poor). `method` can be used to select a specific optimization algorithm (the default is usually fine), and `jac` allows you to pass a function that computes the Jacobian matrix if desired.

We can obtain the 1$\\sigma$ uncertainties on the parameters by taking the square root of the diagonal elements. In other words, this gives a measure of how much each parameter would need to change in order to double the standard deviation of the fit residuals, which is a good measure of how reliable the parameters are."
