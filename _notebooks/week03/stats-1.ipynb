    "In the first notebook, we used `numpy`, `scipy`, and `matplotlib` to visualize the output of mathematical functions. For the next couple of weeks, we will explore the use of python tools to analyze experimental data. Specifically, this week we will focus on visualizing experimental data and performing some basic statistical analysis. Python's statistics capabilities are not quite as fully-featured as the `R` language (though if you need it, the [`rpy2` package](https://pypi.org/project/rpy2/) provides a python interface to `R`), but are extensive enough for most scientific applications.\n",

    "\n",
    "The [`pandas` package](https://pandas.pydata.org/), which is part of the SciPy ecosystem, is one of the most widely-used packages when working with most types of experimental data. The package provides two useful data structures:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [`pandas.Series`](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.Series.html) is essentially a 1D `numpy.ndarray` with extra features: it allows each entry to have an arbitrary label rather then just an integer index starting from 0. Like `numpy.ndarray` objects, a `pandas.Series` object has a fixed length, and all of the entries must be of the same type. These could be floats, ints, strings, or other types. In nearly all cases, a function that works on a `numpy.ndarray` will also work exactly the same on a `pandas.Series`.\n",
    "- [`pandas.Dataframe`](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.html) represents a 2D table of data, where each row and column may be labeled. Essentially, it is a table in which each column is a `pandas.Series` object. The columns do not all need to be the same length or of the same type, and the number of columns can be changed at any time. The data in the table are aligned by the labels for each `pandas.Series` object. This is a very powerful feature that is discussed in a bit more detail below.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is strongly recommended that you read over the `pandas` [Intro to Data Structures](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/dsintro.html) article and [10 Minutes to `pandas`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/10min.html) to get a sense for what these structures are capable of. In this notebook we will only have the chance to highlight a few features. Before we dive into real data, let's take a look at a simple example to illustrate how these data structures work.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our example will be a simple gradebook for a class of 5 students with a few assignments. We'll first create a `pandas.Series` object containing the students' names, using their student ID numbers as the \"index.\"\n"

Both `pandas.Series` and `pandas.Dataframe` also have methods like `add`, `sub`, `mul`, `div`, `pow`, `sum` and so on which are better to use than `+`, `-`, `*` etc., because they allow you to control how `NaNs` are treated explicitly if you wish.

For instance, [gender (`RIAGENDR`)](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/Nchs/Nhanes/2017-2018/DEMO_J.htm#RIAGENDR) is coded as 1 for male and 2 for female, and in the current dataset those are the only two categories.

Since the numbers themselves don't have any meaning, it is more useful to tell `pandas` that the numbers represent categories of data. This will allow for more meaningful grouping of data, and enables some plotting methods to automatically generate graphs or perform analysis broken down by category if desired.

    "\n",
    "There are many ways to export dataframes. If you want to open them in Excel later, exporting as csv with [`DataFrame.to_csv`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.to_csv.html) is one option, or you can write directly to excel using [`DataFrame.to_excel`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.to_excel.html). Each file format has advantages and limitations; for instance, if we wtire to a csv file and read it back in, the columns we set as categorical will not be loaded in as categorical (the csv file doesn't have a way to record the type of the column, so when it is read, `pandas` just has to read the data in as strings or numbers). Perhaps the file format that provides the best mix of high efficiency, fast access, full-features storage, and ease of loading is HDF5, which can be written with [`DataFrame.to_hdf`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.to_hdf.html) and read with [`pandas.read_hdf`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.read_hdf.html).\n",

HDF5 files can store multiple objects, and the key is used to identify the object in the file. We could store several dataframes if we wished, we would just need to add `append=True` to the arguments for subsequent `to_hdf` calls and give each object its own key.\n",
