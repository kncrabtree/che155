    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we're going to be taking the core ideas from the first notebook, and abstracting all of the computation away using the relatively high-level interface by PyTorch. \n",
    "\n",
    "I highly recommend using the PyTorch documentation as a reference, in particular [the page on the `torch.nn` module](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html) is where I frequently go back to, as it provides instructions (and equations) on relevant implementations in PyTorch. When in doubt, you can also go one layer deeper into the problem, and start looking into the source code.\n",
    "\n",
    "## A Guide to the PyTorch Interface\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we dive into any coding, we should assess how PyTorch as an API is laid out, so you will know where to look for things as you need to. There's also a level of underlying design choices to consider, so that when it comes to routine model building we can take advantage of PyTorch _and_ Python as languages as much as possible. As eluded to in the first notebook, PyTorch is very much an object-oriented and [Pythonic](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/) library, and so there's a strong emphasis on not needing to repeat code by taking advantage of things like inheritance. For the most part, building models in PyTorch is essentially building classes in Python—all of the standard neural network layers are built off the same class, and so will your own models/layers. This substantially reduces the need for a lot of different boiler plate codes, for example when you come to implement training loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "For most purposes, the `torch.nn` module provides access to high-level, object-oriented implementations of standard neural network building blocks, including your standard fully-connected layer (`nn.Linear`), convolution layers (e.g. `nn.Conv1d`), and recurrent layers (e.g. `nn.LSTMCell`). All of these objects inherit from the `nn.Module` base class, and abstracts away a lot of concepts like nesting multiple layers, saving and loading models, moving your code onto GPUs, and hopping between training and evaluation phases. The `torch.nn` module also provides access to other neural network tools, such as standard activation functions and losses (see notebook 2)—these also inherit from `nn.Module`. \n",
    "\n",
    "While `torch.nn` modules give you access to objects that represent the building blocks, when it comes to computation they actually just call routines in their functional `torch.nn.functional` interface; for example, `nn.ReLU()` creates an object that, at runtime, calls `torch.nn.functional.relu()` on your inputs. In principle, you could build entire models using only the functional interface, but because you're giving up the benefits of class inheritance, you will have to write a lot of boiler plate code. An intermediate solution is to write a mixture of `torch.nn` and `torch.nn.functional` calls, but if you want the code to be simple and unified you should keep this to a minimum and use the recommended object-oriented interface. To go down yet another layer, `torch.nn.functional` ends up using low-level C/C++/CUDA routines, including those from Caffe2. The other submodule of `torch` you will frequently access is `torch.optim`, which provides access to various optimization algorithms. Each implemented optimizer inherits from `torch.optim.BaseOptimizer`, which has a very similar implementation to `torch.nn.Module`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, at the top level of `torch` are standard math functions and random number generation. So for the most part, this is a drop and replace of NumPy routines, like `torch.exp` and `torch.rand`. One key difference between the two interfaces is the keyword argument `axis` in NumPy is actually `dim` in PyTorch. So when performing operations on nominally the type of array, you will have to swap the kwargs.\n",

This is a standard and important practice in machine learning. The idea is to ensure that the model isn't \"overfitting\" the training data and memorizing exactly how to reproduce the examples it's seen. We want the model to also be able to provide meaningful predictions for data that it hasn't previously seen. If the model performs well (has a low loss) for the training data, but performs poorly for the test/validation data, then it is likely that the model is either overtrained or requires additional [regularization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regularization_(mathematics)).\n",

In particular, minibatching is a widely used method for training models: instead of computing the loss for the entire dataset and updating the model, a \"mini-batch\" of samples is drawn from the dataset and the model is updated based only on those samples. The process is repeated until all/most samples have been used, and this comprises one training \"epoch.\" This algorithm is beneficial both from a computational standpoint (it allows for speedups in the underlying calculations by using parallel algorithms without requiring excessive memory use) and from a practical standpoint: the model is less likely to get stuck in a local minimum of the loss function. Because of the computational efficiency, mini-batching is also often used for computing validation losses as well.\n",

    "With the data in place, we can create a classifier model for the Moon Data. As mentioned before, PyTorch is written such that its models/layers are reusable: each inherits from `torch.nn.Module` so that it can be reused and is interoperable. At its simplest, a `torch.nn.Module` object needs to implement a `forward` function that takes an input tensor `X` and performs a forward pass of the calculation. This may involve one or more layers of calculations, activations, transformations, or other operations. Any calculations should be performed using `torch` functions so that gradients can later be passed through the network by backpropagation.\n",

Here we will show one strategy that makes use of `torch.nn.Sequential`, which is a convenience class that stores a series of [`torch.nn.Module`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.Sequential.html) objects that will be called in sequence. We will simply use a sequence of linear layers followed by activation functions. Since our input MoonData has 2 features, the first linear layer must have an input size of 2. The [`torch.nn.Linear`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.Linear.html) class is an implementation of a fully-connected linear layer like we've used before: it takes the number of input features and the number of output features as arguments to its constructor (along with an optional `bias` parameter that controls whether or not to include bias parameters-- the default is True). Internally, the object will initialize all of the parameters needed for the linear layer calculation. We don't have to keep track of those ourselves! Of course, PyTorch does provide mechanisms for allowing you to access/initialize the parameters manually if you need to do so.\n",
    "\n",
    "After each linear layer, we will include an activation layer. Many standard types are [available](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#non-linear-activations-weighted-sum-nonlinearity) as `torch.nn.Module` objects for convenience, and they are also available through PyTorch's [functional interface](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.functional.html#non-linear-activation-functions) if you wish to use them as functions directly instead of as modules. Just to illustrate, we'll use ReLU and Tanh along the way.\n",

Therefore, for every input, we want to produce 1 number that ideally is 0 or 1. As we saw previously, the sigmoid activation function is useful for this purpose. Our final layer will have an output size of 1, and we will run it through a sigmoid layer to compress that number into the range \\[0,1\\]."

There are many [optimizers available](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/optim.html#algorithms), but they all require as a first argument a list of model parameters. As long as our model is a `torch.nn.Module`, we can access its parameters easily with the `parameters()` function. Each algorithm may also take other optional arguments, which are model hyperparameters. Here we set the learning rate of the gradient descent algorithm to 0.3.\n"

It is possible to define your own layers and combine them into a model, add normalization, dropout, pooling, or other features, and so on. The pytorch interface is very flexible and allows you to mix and match pieces in nearly any way you want."
