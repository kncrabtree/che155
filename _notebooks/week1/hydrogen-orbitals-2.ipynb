    "In this notebook, we'll look at a few more ways to plot data, and will work on refactoring our `h_orbital` code into a python class to make our code more modular and reusable. This will also make it easy for us to transform into Cartesian coordinates instead of spherical coordinates, and allow us to plot orbitals from different atoms on the same graph. Along the way, we'll discuss good coding practices."

    "## Creating the HAtom class\n",
    "\n",
    "Classes are data structures that contain both variables and functions. When using a class in your code, you create an **object** which is an instance of the class. The class definition tells what the object is made from and how it is built, and the object itself is what interacts with the rest of your code. Using classes and objects in your code has several benefits:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data organization**: The variables associated with an object are bundled together. As we'll see, if we want to plot mutliple atoms, we might want to keep track of each atom's center position and quantum numbrers. Instead of keeping track of everything in a master list, we can instead create each atom as an object that keeps track of its own data. It also keeps related code together so that when there is a problem, you know where to look to fix it.\n",
    "- **Reusability**: Once you have created a class that you like, you can import that class into other code that you write. Many of the python data structures you've used (strings, figures, axes) are classes.\n",
    "- **Flexibility**: Classes can be \"extended\" by creating a subclass that inherits all of the variables and functions from the parent class. This makes it easy to add new functionality without having to rewrite everything from scratch.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll start by building a basic class for the hydrogen atom. If you have never built a python class, have a look at this [basic tutorial](http://openbookproject.net/thinkcs/python/english3e/classes_and_objects_I.html) before reading the code below.

When creating a class, it is good practice to describe what the class is used for, and to document all of the functions and attributes that a class user needs to know about. Writing detailed comments in your code is **always** a good idea, especially when the code is complicated. Good comments will save you time in the long run, and will make it much easier for people to work on your code (especially your future self!).\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we've included [type hints](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/) into the function signature, which lets the user know what kinds of input the functions expect and what kind of output they produce. The arguments to `__init__` are all integers, and it does not return anything, while the `orbital` function expects arrays and returns an array. Python as a language uses [Duck Typing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_typing), so it doesn't enforce that the parameters you pass to a function be of the types specifiec by the type hints. They are mostly used to inform the end user of how you, as the programmer, intended for the function to work, even if python allows it to be used in other ways that you did not intend. There are also some external tools that can be used to analyze your code and warn you if a parameter you pass to a function doesn't match the function's type hints, and that can be useful to find bugs in large projects.\n",

    "You might be surprised to see that we're still getting a warning message about an invalid value in the divide function. This is due to the way that the `np.where` function works: first both `np.zeros_like` and `np.arccos` are evaluated at **all** values of `r` to build 2 arrays (we'll call them `a` and `b`). Then, `np.where` evaluates the condition `np.isclose(r,0.0)` for each value of `r`, and chooses the value from array `a` if the condition is true or array `b` if it is false. Because `np.arccos` is evaluated at `r=0`, there is a divide by zero, so a warning is brought up. Since we know that this is unavoidable, we can suppress the warning ising the python [`warnings`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/warnings.html) module."

This will highlight a key advantage of using classes.\n",

Then, when we convert `x`, `y`, and `z` to spherical coordinates, we need to subtract the atom's location coordinate from the Cartesian coordinate, like `x_ = (x-x0)`. This means that the `to_spherical` function needs to know `x0`, `y0`, and `z0`. We can either modify the function so that it takes 6 arguments or, better, make the function a part of the class itself, which we'll do here."

    "The `matplotlib` library has support for 3D plotting through the [`mplot3d` interface](https://matplotlib.org/mpl_toolkits/mplot3d/tutorial.html). It is primarily designed to generate 3D plots where $z = f(x,y)$; that is, a 3D visualization of 2D functions. It is not a complete 3D graphics/rendering solution. Our situation is that we have a true 3D function, since $\\psi = f(x,y,z)$. Typical visualizations of atomic orbitals are made by plotting [isosurfaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isosurface). Unfortunately, there is no one-line `matplotlib` plotting mechanism that can find isosurfaces, so in order to make such a plot we have to calculate the isosurface ourselves. The details are beyond the scope of the course, but some example code is shown below."

    "- [`numpy.ndarray`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.ndarray.html) objects are the preferred way to represent numerical data, and `numpy` versions of math functions should be used because they allow for fast, [vectorized](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/glossary.html#term-vectorization) code and support [broadcasting](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/basics.broadcasting.html).\n",
    "- When working with floating point numbers, be aware of numerical stability and artifacts, especially when comparing floating point numbers or when dividing them (division by 0!)\n",
    "- Classes and subclasses can be a useful way to make your code more modular, flexible, and reusable\n",
    "- [`matplotlib`](https://matplotlib.org/) is a standard library for visualizing data. It works by creating a [`Figure`](https://matplotlib.org/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.figure.Figure.html#matplotlib.figure.Figure) object and addint one or more [`Axes`](https://matplotlib.org/api/axes_api.html#matplotlib.axes.Axes) objects that represent individual graphs to display data. We looked at the following plotting methods\n",
    "    - [`Axes.plot`](https://matplotlib.org/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.axes.Axes.plot.html) makes line graphs, good for looking at a 1D function or a set of (x,y) data points. A related method is [`Axes.scatter`](https://matplotlib.org/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.axes.Axes.scatter.html).\n",
    "    - [`Axes.pcolormesh`](https://matplotlib.org/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.axes.Axes.pcolormesh.html) can show data of the form $f(x,y)$, and is useful when the data are on an irregualr grid. When the data are evenly spaced, [`Axes.imshow`](https://matplotlib.org/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.axes.Axes.imshow.html) is preferred.\n",
    "    - For 3D plotting, we looked briefly at the [`mplot3d` interface](https://matplotlib.org/mpl_toolkits/mplot3d/tutorial.html) and [`plotly`](https://plotly.com/python/), the latter of which is especially useful for making interactive plots on the web.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, though we did not show it in these notebooks, figures made by `matplotlib` can be saved to an image file using [`Figure.savefig`](https://matplotlib.org/3.2.2/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.figure.Figure.html#matplotlib.figure.Figure.savefig), which allows writing to a .png, .pdf, .eps., o .ps file (depending on the backend in use).\n",
