    "Let's start by writing a Python function that will calculate the value of the wavefunction at a point in space. To do so, the function requires $r$, $\\theta$, $\\phi$, $n$, $\\ell$, and $m$. We also see that we need to evaluate factorials, a generalized Laguerre polynomial $L^{2\\ell+1}_{n-\\ell-1}(r)$, and a spherical harmonic function $Y_\\ell^m(\\theta,\\phi)$. In your earlier experience with python, you have probably encountered the [math.factorial](https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/math.html#math.factorial) function, but the standard python libraries do not have pre-existing implementations of $L^{2\\ell+1}_{n-\\ell-1}(r)$ and $Y_\\ell^m(\\theta,\\phi)$. These functions are, however, available in SciPy, so you can save a lot of time using a premade implementation rather than writing your own. In addition, the functions available in SciPy are often based on well-known and studied implementations, and are much more likely to be efficient and bug-free than one you would come up with yourself. Where possible, always try to make use of SciPy and NumPy, as we will do in this course.\n",

For the spherical harmonics, we have $Y_l^m(\\theta,\\phi)$, and the function signature is `sph_harm(m,n,theta,phi)` for $Y_n^m(\\theta,\\phi)$. You might think therefore that `m` = $m$, `n` = $\\ell$, `theta`=$\\theta$ and `phi`=$\\phi$, and if so, you would be making a big mistake! If you read the parameter definitions, `theta` is the \"azimuthal angle\" with  in the range $[0,2\\pi]$ and `phi` is the \"colatitudinal angle\" in the range $[0,\\pi]$.

    "To do the same calculation with NumPy's `ndarray` structures, we can take advantage of [broadcasting](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/basics.broadcasting.html). Broadcasting is how NumPy operations automatically loop over arrays. We were using this before to evaluate $\\psi$ at all values of $r$ in our 1D array. As explained in the documentation if we have 2 variables that we want to evaluate in a function `func(x,y)`, such as a set of 100 x coordinates and a set of 100 y coordinates, the behavior depends on how we set up the x and y arrays. If both arrays are 1D, that is, their shapes are both `(100,)` then the function is evaluated 100 times. The first time is at `x[0],y[0]`, the second at `x[1],y[1]`, and so on. The output in that case is a 1D array that is the same shape as both input arrays: `(100,)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, if we want to evaluate at every possible combination of `x` and `y`, we we need to make `x` and `y` each 2D arrays with different shapes. We've seen that when the input arrays have the same shape, the output has the same shape as the inputs. When NumPy encounters an operation with differently-shaped arrays, it follows broadcasting rules to make the shapes compatible if possible. Importantly, the broadcasting rules state that when comparing the axis size for arrays, they either must match exactly, or one of them must be size 1. If we set up `x` as a 2D array with 100 entries in the first dimension, and 1 entry in the second dimension, we have a 2D array with shape `(100,1)`. The only difference between this 2D array and our original 1D array is that the 2D array has a second axis of length 1. The data inside the 2D array is the exact same as the 1D array. According to the broadcasting rules, if we set up `y` as a 1x100 array (shape `(1,100)`), when we call `func(x,y)`, the output will be a 100x100 array (shape `(100,100)`). This is because NumPy looks at each axis in the arrays starting from the last axis, and each axis of size 1 is stretched to match the longer axis.\n",

    "As you read the `matplotlib` documentation, you will see that it references the \"pyplot API\" and the \"object-oriented API.\" While both are perfectly valid, we will use the object-oriented API here. This is mostly to prevent errors that may happen when you use a notebook environment and execute cells in different orders. First we need to import the library and create a new set of `Figure` and `Axes` objects. The `Figure` is like the container for one or more plots, and the unfortunately-named `Axes` object (not to be confused with an `Axis` object!) is one of the plots. We can create the `Figure` and `Axes` with another unfortunately-named command: [`pyplot.subplots`](https://matplotlib.org/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.subplots.html?highlight=subplots#matplotlib.pyplot.subplots). Although that function can create a figure with multiple subplots, when called without arguments, it actualy produces a figure with only one plot, which is what we want in this case."

    "We'll start by making a 1D visualization of the $1s$ orbital as a function of $r$ at a single value of $\\theta$ and $\\phi$. To do this, we will take [slices](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/arrays.indexing.html#basic-slicing-and-indexing) of the `psi_1s` array. We're also using the [`np.real`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.real.html) function to take only the real part of the wavefunction. The $1s$ orbital is entirely real anyways, so this does not discard any information; later we will deal with other wavefunctions that are complex.\n",

If only 1 array is present, then it is interpreted as the y data for the plot, and the x values will be the point number in the array (0, 1, 2, 3, ...). If 2 arrays are present, then they must be the same size, and the first array contains the x values and the second array contains the corresponding y values. Here we take our 1D slice of `psi_1s` at $\\theta=0$, $\\phi=0$, and plot it against a 1D slice of `rg`. In the call to `Axes.plot`, we start with the x data, then the y data, and then we can specify additional arguments that customize the appearance of the curve. More details on the options that are available are in the documentation link above; here we'll just add a label that will later show up in a plot legend."
