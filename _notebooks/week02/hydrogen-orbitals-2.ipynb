    "#### Conversion of Cartesian to spherical coordinates\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we get started on making 2D and 3D plots, we need a function that can convert Cartesian coordinates into spherical coordinates.  Using trigonometric functions, it is easy to derive the expressions for the spherical coordinates from $x, y, z$ as follows:\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "However, when applying these formulas there is quickly a problem.  Notice that for $\\theta$, there will be a divide-by-zero error at the origin.  Even worse, the formula for $\\phi$ returns the same value for $(-x, -y)$ as for $(x, y)$, even though we know the actual $\\phi$ angle differs by $\\pi$ for these two points.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Both problems can be solved by using the `np.arctan2(y, x)` function.  This function takes in two arguments that would normally be divided in the conventional arctangent, thus giving it the ability to return values in the full range of $\\phi$.  Also, this function returns standard values when one or both inputs are equal to zero; if we had used `np.arctan`, this would have resulted in errors.  \n",

Its main function signature is `pcolormesh(X,Y,C)` where the arguments are the x values, the y values, and the data to be plotted. By passing the same arguments into `Axes.contour()` we can also create level curves.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our coordinate and function data are stored in 3D arrays, but `pcolormesh()` can only plot 2D data.  Therefore we need to use indexing to extract a 2D slice out of each 3D array.  This is done using the syntax `xg[:,0,:], zg[:,0,:], psi_3p[:,0,:]` to extract all values in the $x$ and $z$ dimensions but keep only the zeroth element for $y$.  (In this example we only had one value in the $y$ dimension, but reducing the array dimension is still essential.)\n",
    "\n",
    "We also called `ax.set_aspect('equal', 'box')`.  With this, the size and extent of the horizontal and vertical axes will be set equal and the plot area will be made square.  Otherwise the plot will appear squashed in one direction or another.  This comes in handy when both axes correspond to Cartesian coordinates, and various other situations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, a color scale is useful for knowing the correspondence between color and function value.  The color scale is the return value of `pcolormesh()`, and it is passed to `Figure.colorbar()` to add a special Axes object containing the color bar."

Although it is possible to do, one needs to separately calculate the isosurface, and then pass it to Matplotlib as a collection of triangular faces.  On the other hand, the plotly package does support isosurfaces, and the resulting plots are interactive to boot.  Here is an example code for creating a 3D isosurface in Plotly.\n",

    "Check out the [plotly `Isosurface` documentation](https://plotly.com/python-api-reference/generated/plotly.graph_objects.Isosurface.html). The most important keyword arguments are `x`, `y`, `z`, and `value`, representing the coordinates and function value on a grid of points. Unlike Matplotlib's `pcolormesh`, the coordinate arrays and values are all expected to be 1-D arrays, which can be easily done using the `array.flatten()` method. This is because the `Isosurface` class does not require points to be on a regular 3-D grid.\n",

    "Other arguments to `Isosurface` include specifying the color scale (`colorscale`), and plotting multiple surfaces by specifying a minimum and maximum value (`isomin` and `isomax`), as well as how many isosurfaces we want (`surface_count`). The `caps` allows the edges of the 3D plot to show the interior of the isosurface (see [Matlab's documentation](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/visualize/isocaps-add-context-to-visualizations.html) for a conceptual explanation, because plotly's documentation is unclear).

    "There are many possible ways to extend this code. You can write a function that makes it convenient to draw multiple orbitals, each having a different set of three quantum numbers and a different origin. Ultimately you could make visualizations of the MO diagrams that you see in organic and inorganic chemistry textbooks. The possibilities are endless!"
