    "It is possible (though not very common) to implement least squares fitting together with the numerical integration in order to estimate the kinetics parameters. We'll walk through the process here. Last time we used `scipy.optimize.least_squares`, which required us to calculate the residuals vector between the model and the experimental data. When using integrated rate equations, this was straightforward because we could just plug in the time for each data point into the model and compute the model's prediction. With numerical integration; however, we do not have such a function!\n",

If we choose time steps judiciously, we can make sure that we always sample the model at each time point needed. If we inspect the data frame, we can see that all of the time points are at a multiple of 0.1 ms."

It is theoretically possible to improve this with `least_squares`, but there are now 6 rate coefficients and an extra parameter for the percentage of H$_2$ that would need to be optimized as well, which makes the process slow.

This is a matrix that has 1s in the positions where the Jacobian may be nonzero, and 0s where the Jacobian is always 0. The algorithms in the `solve_ivp` function can use that information to speed up the calculations because it can reduce the number of calculations it needs to perform. When the reaction network is large, there may be only a few reactions linked to some molecules, and the rows/columns corresponding to that element may contain many 0s. The sparsity structure depends only on the reaction network, not the state of the system, so we can precalculate it before running `solve_ivp`. For completeness, we'll do it here."
