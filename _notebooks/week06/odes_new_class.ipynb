    "It is possible (though not very common) to implement least squares fitting together with the numerical integration in order to estimate the kinetics parameters. We'll walk through the process here. Last time we used `scipy.optimize.least_squares`, which required us to calculate the residuals vector between the model and the experimental data. When using integrated rate equations, this was straightforward because we could just plug in the time for each data point into the model and compute the model's prediction. With numerical integration; however, we do not have such a function!\n",

If we choose time steps judiciously, we can make sure that we always sample the model at each time point needed. If we inspect the data frame, we can see that all of the time points are at a multiple of 0.1 ms."

    "- `method` selects which numerical integration method will be employed. The default, `'RK45'`, is the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method, but several others are available, including some implicit solvers that are important when problems are \"stiff.\" A system of equations is stiff when the solutions are very sensitive to the step size even when the solution appears \"smooth.\" Chemical kinetics problems are frequently stiff when there are some very slow reactions combined with others that are very fast, and you want to evaluate the system over a long time compared with the rate of the fast reactions. In the current example, all of the reactions have comparable rates, so we will stick with `'RK45'`, but often the `'Adams'` or `'Radau'` methods are more appropriate for kinetics problems.\n",
    "- `t_eval` is a list of times at which the model returns abundances. If this is None, the model only gives the results at the final time. If we pass an array of times, the results will contain the abundances at all of the time values specified in `t_eval` which fall within `t_span`\n",
    "- `dense_output` causes the solver to construct functions that interpolate between time steps. This allows you to (approximately) evaluate the model at any time, not just at the time steps that were used in the model.\n",

    "Note that nowhere do you need to specify the step size! All of the methods employ various algorithms to automatically determine the step size needed to bring the error down to a certain desired value.
